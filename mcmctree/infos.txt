This folder contains all MCMCTree analyses for dating the passerine GH gene duplication.
Each folder is named according to the distribution used for added fossil calibrations.

Inside each folder:
GH_CDS_Alignment.phy       : coding sequence alignment used for the analysis (same for all analyses)
calibrations.txt           : fossil calibrations used (same for all analyses, so far)
(distribution)_tree.trees  : starting tree with added fossil calibrations
 
Each folder contains subfolders for different settings of usedata:
prior/   : no data used (usedata = 0)
hessian/ : branch length estimation (usedata = 3)
approx/  : approximate likelihood calculation (usedata = 2)
Each subfolder contains: 
- its control file (.ctl)
- the output files generated during that step ( Currently only the FigTree.tre output for prior/ and approx/)

The duplication node of interest (GH gene duplication in passerines) corresponds to node number 509.
To reproduce a run:

# set the base directory of the analysis
base= # replace this with the path to the analysis folder

# step 1: estimates branch lengths
cd $base/hessian
mcmctree mcmctree.ctl

# step 2: copy out.BV into the approx/ subfolder and rename it to in.BV automatically
cp out.BV $base/approx/in.BV

# step 3: performs the dating analysis using the branch lengths
cd $base/approx
mcmctree mcmctree.ctl
