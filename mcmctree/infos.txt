This folder contains all MCMCTree analyses for dating the passerine GH gene duplication.
Each folder is named according to the distribution used for added fossil calibrations.

Inside each folder:
GH_CDS_Alignment.phy       : coding sequence alignment used for the analysis (same for all analyses)
calibrations.txt           : fossil calibrations used (same for all analyses, so far)
(distribution)_tree.trees  : starting tree with added fossil calibrations
 
Each folder contains subfolders for different settings of usedata:
prior/   : no data used (usedata = 0)
hessian/ : branch length estimation (usedata = 3)
approx/  : approximate likelihood calculation (usedata = 2)
Each subfolder (prior/, hessian/, approx/) contains its control file and output files from that step.
So far, I have uploaded the FigTree.tre output for both prior/ and approx/

The duplication node of interest (GH gene duplication in passerines) corresponds to node t_n509 in the trees.
To reproduce a run, go into the analysis folder and run MCMCTree using the ctl file in the appropriate subfolder (hessian/ or approx/).
